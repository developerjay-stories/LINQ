In the previous section, you have learned about LINQ Query Syntax. Here, you will learn about Method syntax.

Method syntax (also known as fluent syntax) uses extension methods included in the Enumerable or Queryable static class, 
similar to how you would call the extension method of any class.

The compiler converts query syntax into method syntax at compile time.

The following is a sample LINQ method syntax query that returns a collection of strings which contains a word "Tutorials".

Example: LINQ Method Syntax in C#
// string collection
IList<string> stringList = new List<string>() { 
    "C# Tutorials",
    "VB.NET Tutorials",
    "Learn C++",
    "MVC Tutorials" ,
    "Java" 
};

// LINQ Query Syntax
var result = stringList.Where(s => s.Contains("Tutorials"));
